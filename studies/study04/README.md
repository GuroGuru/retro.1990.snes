### SnesDevStudies 4 - Incrementing

This study shows how to **increment register values**. Here we learn 2 new adressing modes: the zero page mode (access only the first page of memory, thus faster) and the implicit mode (in instructions like **inx** the address is implied)

#### Topics introduced:

- Instructions:
    - [x] adc, inx, iny (add)

- Addressing modes:
    - [x] Zero page: $c0
    - [x] Zero page,X: $c0,X
    - [x] Implicit
